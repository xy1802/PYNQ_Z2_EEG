# PYNQ_Z2_EEG
My experiment about EEG signal processing using PYNQ_Z2.  
Only one part of the project here, another code is provided by my lab, so I won't upload them.  

Attention that I use PyTorch on PYNQ_z2, you need to make it on ARM before you use my code.  
You can download the dataset from the links below.
